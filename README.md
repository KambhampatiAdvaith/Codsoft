| #   | Project                         | Objective                                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ | **Credit Card Fraud Detection** | Detect fraudulent transactions from anonymized card usage data |
| 2️⃣ | **Customer Churn Prediction**   | Predict if a customer is likely to discontinue a service       |
| 3️⃣ | **SMS Spam Detection**          | Classify text messages as spam or legitimate                   |
